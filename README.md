# chalk

Open sourced an old project of mine that was never wrapped up into production quality code:
- `chalk.cks` a persistent class that gathers analysis outputs, references a jinja template, and renders the template as an html report.  The main use case was to provide a convenient storage for intermediary results and a automatic way of rendering and version controlling the results to html.
- `chalk.cksx` a set SAP extractors that do a bit of magic with threading to open multiple connections and download in parallel.
